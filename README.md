# Work Day Planner


## Description

This webpage is meant to allow you to plan out your day by entering items into the text area and then clicking the save button. It will display the date at the top of the screen and keep your plans even if the page is refreshed.

## Installation

There is no real installation required but you can access the page by going to https://pdangerfield.github.io/Workday-Planner/

## Usage

When you load the page (https://pdangerfield.github.io/Workday-Planner/) you will come across a page that has different rows for the business hours where you can put in your plans to make sure you stay organized. The rows will be color coded to show grey for hours that are in the past, red for the current hour you are in, and green for future hours. You can type what you need into the text areas on each hours row and then click the save button on the right side of each row that will save your entry and keep it there even if the page is refreshed.
